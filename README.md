## Development Tools

This project uses several development tools to ensure code quality:

### Selene - Static Analysis
[Selene](https://kampfkarren.github.io/selene/) is used for static analysis and linting of Lua/Luau code.

**Usage:**
```bash
# Run linting
npm run lint

# Run linting with minimal output
npm run lint:fix
```

**Configuration:**
- Configuration file: `selene.toml`
- Standard library: Roblox
- VS Code integration via the Selene extension

**Key Rules:**
- Detects undefined variables, unused variables, and shadowing
- Validates Roblox-specific APIs and patterns
- Enforces code quality standards

### VS Code Setup
Install the recommended extensions:
- `Kampfkarren.selene-vscode` - Selene integration
- `evaera.vscode-rojo` - Rojo integration  
- `JohnnyMorganz.luau-lsp` - Luau language server

### Pre-commit Hooks
Pre-commit hooks are configured to run Selene automatically before commits:

```bash
# Install pre-commit (if not already installed)
pip install pre-commit

# Install the hooks
pre-commit install
```

### Continuous Integration
GitHub Actions automatically runs:
- Selene linting
- Rojo build verification
- Code quality checks

All checks must pass before merging pull requests.
